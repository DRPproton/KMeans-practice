# KMeans Clustering Ejercicio

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`Ejercicio_KMeans_Dashel.ipynb`) that demonstrates the application of the KMeans clustering algorithm. The notebook includes a step-by-step guide to implementing KMeans clustering, including data preprocessing, model training, and results visualization.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, yellowbrick

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/DRPproton/KMeans-practice.git`
2. Install the required Python packages: `pipenv install`
3. To run the virtual enviroment: `pipenv shell`
4. To run jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook`

## Usage
Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially to see the KMeans clustering in action.
